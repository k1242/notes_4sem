And nonlinearities lies in the optical gain function, wich, due to several articles can be explained as:
\begin{equation}
	g \symeq = g_0 g_n(N-N_0) + g_P(P- P_0).
\end{equation}

All theory gathered from book: "Semiconductor Lasers I -- Fundamentals" by Eli Kapon, Institute of Micro and Optoelectronics Department of Physics, Swiss (1999).
