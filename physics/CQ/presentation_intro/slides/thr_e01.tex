And God said let there be light, and there was light
\begin{equation}
	\triangle E(\vc{r},t) - \mu_0 \varepsilon(\vc{r}) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} E(\vc{r}, t) = \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} P_{in}(\vc{r},t)
\end{equation}
Which is solved as
\begin{equation*}
	E(\vc{r},t) = \frac{1}{2} E_0 e^{i(\beta y - \omega t)} + \const
\end{equation*}
And we assume:
\begin{equation*}
	E(\vc{r}, t) = A(t) E(s').
\end{equation*}
