\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fresnel diffraction} (obstacle, slit) was observed. Based on this effect, it is possible to measure the slit thickness with relatively good accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Diffraction on a half-plane} was observed, a quantitative description of the effect was obtained, coinciding with experiment.
    \item \textbf{Fraunhofer diffraction} at one and two slits was observed. Measurements of the distance between slits and the size of the slits are possible with good accuracy.
    \item It is important to keep the optical centering of the system in order to observe the desired effects.
\end{itemize}
