With used amplifiers, the following oscillations at the amplifier output with DC power can be observed:

\begin{center}
    \incfig{scheme5}
\end{center}

This is due to the instability of the amplifier. 
% This instability can be eliminated by the adjustment of the scheme.

The main problem is that desired oscillations $\sim 10$ ns. \\

We proceeded to experiments with faster amplifiers, but it is usefull to understnd results of such delays.
