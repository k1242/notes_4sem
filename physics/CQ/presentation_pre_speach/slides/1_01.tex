\textit{Globally} we would like to 
transmit a high-frequency signal in encrypted form.

\phantom{42}

Here, we will consider the following steps towards this goal:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{dynamical chaos and synchronization \\ 
    (to encrypt and decrypt signal);}
    \iitem{theory of the laser evolution and its adaptation under our needs;}
    \iitem{realization of the positive feedback in laser: \\
     theory, modeling and experiment.}
\end{itemize}
