As one can obtain after rewritten density matrix in terms of carrier distributions, and in order avoid irrelevantly enormous formulas we get polarization as:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{P}_{in}(\vc{r}, t) = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{P}_{in,0} e^{i (\beta y - \omega t)} + \const =
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	= - \sum \frac{\xi(\vc{r},k_q, x, z)}{V(k_q, x, z)}[\rho_{eh}(k_q, x, z)\mu(k_q, x, z) + \const]	
\end{equation*}
where $V(k_q, x, z)$ is the confinement volume of electrons and holes and
\begin{equation*}
	\xi(\vc{r}, k_q, x, z) = 
	\left\{ \begin{aligned}
		&1, \ \vc{r} \text{ inside V}\\
		&0, \ \vc{r} \text{ outside V}
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation*}
