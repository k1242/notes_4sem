Principal restrictions in implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{High-frequency oscillations,
        so, as we found, equipment for working at a frequency $\geq  (10 \tau_\text{r})^{-1} \approx 200$ MGz is necessary.
    }
    \iitem{No possibility for a specific laser change the frequency of oscillations.}
\end{itemize}


Successes on the way to implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{Optimal values for $\tau_\text{delay}$ and laser range were found selected; stabilized operational amplifiers;}
    \iitem{A scheme has been developed, a slow positive feedback is implemented.}
    \iitem{A video signal transmission system is adjusted, also ovserved the constant behavior
    with $\tau_{\text{i}} \approx 50 \tau_{\text{r}}$
    .}
\end{itemize}
