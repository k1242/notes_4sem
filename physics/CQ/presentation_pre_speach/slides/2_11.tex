\textbf{Thr.} If there is no stationary points on the enclosed 2D region $G$ and some trajectory exists $\gamma \subset G$, then $\gamma$ is a closed loop path or tends to the closed one.

But there is still a hope for a chaos!

We add positive optoelectronic feedback in order to raise to 3D our equation.
\begin{align*}
	&\frac{d S}{d t} = v_g g S - \gamma_p S,\\
	&\frac{d N}{d t} = \frac{J}{e}[1 + \frac{\xi S(t-\tau)}{S_0}] - \gamma_n N - g S.
\end{align*}
