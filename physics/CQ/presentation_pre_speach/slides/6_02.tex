As a result of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{According to the equations of the laser's evolution with a feedback, the \textbf{numerical model was built},
    compliant observations from the article
    , in the ideal and non ideal case.}
    \iitem{It is shown that \textbf{chaos is possible in the system}. Chaos parameters are estimated. The frequency limitation were evaluated for the system. }
    \iitem{Two schemes were implemented: 
    1) our a scheme of positive feedback has been developed and built; 
    2) industrial signal transmission system was adjusted. \\
    $\Rightarrow$ In harmony with theory, there was a constant behavior.
    }
\end{itemize}
