As a result of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{According to the equations of moving the laser with feedback, a \textbf{numerical model was built} in the ideal and nonideal case.}
    \iitem{It is shown that \textbf{chaos is possible in the system}. Chaos parameters are estimated. The limitation of the frequencies of oscillations possible in the system is shown. }
    \iitem{A scheme of positive feedback has been developed and collected. The optimal parameters for the scheme are selected.}
    \iitem{Prepared for use industrial setup.}
\end{itemize}
