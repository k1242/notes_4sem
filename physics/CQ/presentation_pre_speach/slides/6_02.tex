As a result of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{According to the equations of the laser's evolution with a feedback, the \textbf{numerical model was built} in the ideal and non ideal case.}
    \iitem{It is shown that \textbf{chaos is possible in the system}. Chaos parameters are estimated. The frequency limitation were evaluated for the system. }
    \iitem{A scheme of positive feedback has been developed and built. The optimal parameters for the scheme were selected.}
    \iitem{Got prepared for the use of an industrial setup.}
\end{itemize}
