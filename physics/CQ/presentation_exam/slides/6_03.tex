As a result of the project:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{According to the equations of the laser's evolution with a feedback, the \textbf{numerical model was built},
    compliant observations from the article
    , in the ideal and non ideal case.}
   
    \iitem{The another system was observed to show that chaotic systems is all around us. The branches of light were observed and modelled. Also we found an analogy with billiard theory.}
     \iitem{It is shown that \textbf{chaos is possible in the optical systems}. Chaos parameters are estimated. The frequency limitation were evaluated for the system. }
\end{itemize}
