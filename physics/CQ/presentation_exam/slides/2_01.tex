To start the laser idea we need to obtain:
\begin{itemize}
	\iitem{Solution of the Schr\"odinger equation in a semiconductor medium for the wavefunction of an electron;}
	\iitem{Induced polarization for distribution of holes and electrons in a semiconductor;}
	\iitem{Interaction of electrons in a semiconductor with an wave equation and outer electric field.}
\end{itemize}
