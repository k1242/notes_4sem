However, it was not possible to move to the chaotic regime in the laser. Possible cause of the problem may be
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{parasitic capacity and inductance}
    \iitem{We've measured it for our scheme and for $f \sim 1 \ \text{GHz}$ parasitic $L \sim 1 \  \text{nH}$ $R_L \sim 1 \Omega $ } 
    \iitem{skin-effect for $f \sim 1 \ \text{GHz}$ for Cu at $t = 20^{\circ} \ \text{C}$ }
    
    
\end{itemize}
In terms of solutions -- neatly soldered scheme.
