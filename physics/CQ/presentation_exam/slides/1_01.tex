\textit{Globally} we are to observe different realization of dynamic chaos and implement some on our own.

\phantom{42}

Here we will consider the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \iitem{study the dynamical chaos on its own;}
    \iitem{implement laser theory to create chaos;}
    \iitem{model laser behavior and attempt to build a circuit;}
    \iitem{study light branches chaoticly penetrating thin layer;}
    \iitem{model and implement this model.}
\end{itemize}
