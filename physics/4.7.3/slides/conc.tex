\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimated the Brewer Corner for Ebonite.
    \item Classified plates ($\lambda/2, \lambda/4$). 
    % Determined fast and slow axes in the plate $\lambda/4$.
    \item Observed the interfering of polarized light.
    \item Methods for obtaining information about all colors that —Åoul be observed are developed and applied.
    \item Some corelation (monotonous behavior) between Hue of light and wavelength was discovered. This moment requires a deeper study. It would be interesting, knowing the conditional monochromaticity of the light, to build a relationship between HUE (Oor RGB), and Wavelength.
